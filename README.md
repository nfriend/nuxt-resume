My résumé, built with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): https://resume.nathanfriend.io (or

## Data

All of the content of this resume is sourced from
[`resume-data.mjs`](./resume-data.mjs).

Additionally, a `resume-data.private.mjs` file can be created alongside
[`resume-data.mjs`](./resume-data.mjs). This file it `.gitignore`-ed; its
contents will be `require`'d in [`resume-data.mjs`](./resume-data.mjs) when
building this résumé. This is used to protect personal info such as phone
numbers and addresses.

At the moment, the only data point stored inside this file is my phone number.

This file should look something like this:

```js
export const phoneInfo = {
  type: 'phone',
  display: '123.456.7890',
  link: 'tel:123-456-7890',
};
```

## Inspiration

This project's visual style was heavily inspired by the [Universal Résumé
Template](https://universal-resume-pages.netlify.com/).

## resume.json

As part of the CI pipeline, a `resume.json` file that conforms to the
[`resume.json` schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) is extracted from
[`resume-data.mjs`](./resume-data.mjs) and automatically pushed to a [GitLab
Snippet](https://gitlab.com/snippets/1948091) and a [GitHub
Gist](https://gist.github.com/nfriend/36d83b1526df75a663d9c3ad0b1cd630). The
[`ci/generate-resume.json.mjs`](./ci/generate-resume.json.mjs) script is
responsible for this work.

You can view the rendered result at https://registry.jsonresume.org/nfriend.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For other useful commands, check out the `scripts` defined in
[`package.json`](./package.json).

### HTML linting

One `yarn` script in particular - `yarn html-lint` - requires some setup before
it will run:

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- Run `bundle install` at the root of this project
- Run `yarn generate` to generate a production build in `./dist`

Once these prerequisites have been completed, running `yarn html-lint` will run
[`html-proofer`](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) on the output
`*.html`. This is particularly useful for validating that all external links are
still valid.
