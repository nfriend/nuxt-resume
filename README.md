## Data

All of the content of this resume is sourced from
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json). This file loosely adheres to the
[`resume.json` schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) (with some additional
properties for display purposes). See the [resume.json](#resumejson) section
below for more info about `resume.json` compatibility.

Additionally, a `resume-data.private.json` file can be created alongside
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json). This file is `.gitignore`-ed; its
contents will be merged into [`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) when
building this résumé. This is used to protect personal info such as phone
numbers and addresses, while still allowing this data to appear in
locally-generated résumés.

## Inspiration

This project's visual style was heavily inspired by the [Universal Résumé
Template](https://universal-resume-pages.netlify.com/).

## resume.json

As part of the CI pipeline, a `resume.json` file that conforms to the
[`resume.json` schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) is extracted from
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) and automatically pushed to a [GitLab
Snippet](https://gitlab.com/snippets/1948091) and a [GitHub
Gist](https://gist.github.com/nfriend/36d83b1526df75a663d9c3ad0b1cd630). The
[`ci/generate-resume.json.js`](./ci/generate-resume.json.js) script is
responsible for this work.

You can view the rendered result at https://registry.jsonresume.org/nfriend.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For other useful commands, check out the `scripts` defined in
[`package.json`](./package.json).

### HTML linting

One `yarn` script in particular - `yarn html-lint` - requires some setup before
it will run:

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- Run `bundle install` at the root of this project
- Run `yarn generate` to generate a production build in `./dist`

Once these prerequisites have been completed, running `yarn html-lint` will run
[`html-proofer`](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) on the output
`*.html`. This is particularly useful for validating that all external links are
still valid.

### Static generation

During deployment, all Nuxt-related `<script>` elements are stripped from the
compiled HTML. This is accomplished by the `yarn strip-scripts` command, which
calls [`ci/strip-script-elements.js`](ci/strip-script-elements.js). This works
because this application is fully rendered at build time and requires no
client-side hydration.

Stripping these `<script>` elements allows the end result to be truly static (no
JavaScript required), which isn't ([yet](ci/strip-script-elements.js`))
supported by Nuxt.
